###### 1. What is React?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

React (also known as `React.js` or `ReactJS`) is an open source frontend javascript library that is used for building UIs, especially for single-page and mobile applications. It is used for handling the view layer of web and mobile applications.

`React` was created by `Jordan Walke,` a software engineer working for Facebook, and later maintained by the Facebook team. `React` was first deployed on Facebook's newsfeed in 2011 and on Instagram in 2012.
